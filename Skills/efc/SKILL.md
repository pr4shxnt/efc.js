# Express File Cluster (EFC) — Skill

Use this skill whenever you're reading, writing, or debugging EFC code. It loads the exact source-derived facts about this framework so you never invent APIs, import paths, or behaviours that don't exist.

## When to load

- Writing a new route, task, model, or middleware
- Debugging a boot failure or a missing-route issue
- Answering "does EFC support X?" questions
- Any time you're about to type an `import` from `express-file-cluster`

## Routing table — open the module that matches the work

| Situation | Open |
|---|---|
| What is exported and from where | [api-surface.md](api-surface.md) |
| How file paths become URL paths | [routing-rules.md](routing-rules.md) |
| Worker boot sequence (Pre-Flight) | [pre-flight.md](pre-flight.md) |
| Background tasks — defineTask, enqueue, thread | [tasks-internals.md](tasks-internals.md) |
| Auth — issueToken, requireAuth internals | [auth-internals.md](auth-internals.md) |
| Things that do NOT exist (anti-hallucination) | [what-not-to-invent.md](what-not-to-invent.md) |

Load **only** the module the work points to. Each is self-contained.
